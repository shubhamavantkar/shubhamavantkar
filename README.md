## Engineering Focus

Backend and systems engineer building production-grade platforms from scratch.  
Specialized in scalable backend architecture, automation workflows, and cloud-native systems with full product ownership.

I operate across:

- backend architecture
- automation systems
- platform engineering
- startup product execution

---

## Value Proposition

I design and ship systems that:

- scale in real-world production environments  
- automate operational workflows  
- translate business needs into technical systems  
- reduce manual processes through backend automation  

My strength is ownership — architecture, backend, deployment, and long-term maintainability.

## Engineering Philosophy

Build systems that work in the real world.  
Ship early. Architect for scale. Automate aggressively.  
Own outcomes, not just code.
